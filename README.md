Meetup Finder

Welcome to Meetup Finder! This is a web application that allows users to create events and respond to other events as well as find or search for events to attend. Users initially can only see events and their descriptions unless they are logged in with a Google account. Once logged in, users are able to create events as well as RSVP to other events (users can't RSVP to their own event since their attendance is expected). Users are also able to delete and edit their own events, but not events created by others. 

The Home Page is a simply jumbotron displaying the name of the web app and a welcome message. The navbar is present in all pages of the site for easy navigation.

The See Events Page is a list of all events that have been created by users so far. Each event is displayed in a card that has the event's information; users can click on "Details" on the event card to see the location of the event on Google Maps. Users can delete or edit their events by clicking on the respective buttons on their own event.

The Create Event Page is a form that allows users to enter information to create an event.

If not logged in, the navbar displays a Login button on the top right, and if logged in, the navbar displays a Logout button. 
If logged in, a new button on the navbar, Your Profile, appears. Clicking this takes the user to their own account page, where they can see the events they've created as well as the events they have RSVPed to.

Thanks for looking into our app!
